# precision LLM for enhanced life science research
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

An application designed around LLMs (large language model) to assist researchers in doing their awesome science. This tool helps streamline the research process, find relevant literature, generate research ideas, and much more.

Current features include:

- Dynamic LLM type and parameter selection
- Automatic paper proposal
- Add context: the application understand whether you talk about microbiology or cancer and scopes the model accordingly.
- Prompt enhancement via knowledge graph [WIP]


Next: 
- Knowledge graph: Dynamically connect Metabolites with Pathways and Proteins for groups of model organisms
- Add larger context via text upload OR linking
  - to connect whole research corpus check out: https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin
