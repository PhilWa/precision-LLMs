[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

An application designed around LLMs (large language model) to assist researchers in doing their awesome science. This tool helps streamline the research process, find relevant literature, generate research ideas, and much MUCH more.

Current features include:

- Dynamic LLM type and parameter selection
- Prompt enhancement via knowledge graph
- Automatic paper proposal
- Add context: Give to get approach

Next: 
- Knowledge graph: Dynamically connect Metabolites with Pathways and Proteins for groups of model organisms
- Add larger context via text upload OR linking
  - to connect whole research corpus check out: https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin 

Stay posted for more :-)
