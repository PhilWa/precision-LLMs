science.pal is an application designed for researchers in life sciences, based on large language models (LLMs) to help with the scientific process. With the ability to access a predefined knowledge base such as Biorxiv (or potentially any other text corpus of choice), users can work on novel research ideas and easily discover literature. The tool offers dynamic LLM type and parameter selection, enabling customization to meet specific research needs.

This application is build on the idea of dynamic LLM customization and context-aware assistance, catering to diverse research areas. It enhances prompts with a small molecule knowledge graph and inject relevant literature. Upcoming features include wider knowledge graph integration and larger, more dynamic, context support. 

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic LLM Type and Parameter Selection.**
 Tailor the LLM to suit your research needs by choosing appropriate types and parameters.

- **Access biorxiv knowledge base.**
 Retrieve information from over 66,000 abstracts within the Biorxiv knowledge base.

- **Automatic Paper Proposal.**
 The most relevant literature based on your question is selected and shown for you

- **Context-Aware Assistance.**
 science.pal understands the context of your research, whether it's microbiology or cancer, and scopes the model accordingly.

- **Prompt Enhancement via Small Molecule Knowledge Graph.**
 Enrich the biological depth of prompts by integrating information on more than 80,000 small molecules.

### Upcoming Features:

- **Wider Knowledge Graph Integration.**
 Dynamically connect Metabolites, Pathways, and Proteins for a variety of model organisms and provide larger context support.


- **Upload text or link external resources to provide additional context.**
 Connect your manuscript, PowerPoints, research proposal or the grant you are working on, and science.pal will thoughtfully consider the objectives of your work when delivering responses.


**Note**: Future development will focus on deeper Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Model-First design principles to further enhance the application's capabilities. This development will continue in a private repository after the waitlist starts. The public repository will remain available for reference.
